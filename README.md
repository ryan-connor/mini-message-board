## Mini Message Board
Simple message board app based off of an Odin Project Tutorial.

## Description
Simple small project based off of an Odin Project Tutorial to practice Express and EJS. Users can post messages to the page and then view all the messages. Note that since there is not a database, messages will not save after a page reload, only the messages saved directly in the code will remain.

## Why?
The main purpose of this mini project was to practice Express by making a simple message app. To be clear this project is not fully complete, it was used to help practice some concepts, but was not fully finished.
